# Little things that makes daily life easier

## Getting started
Just make sure you have python installed (e.g. from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)) and accessible from the command line. 

### Notifications
Hopefully pip is installed by default. and you just need to do
```bash
python notifications.py
# or
python3 notifications.py
```
If you don't have pip then following the link above will get you conda so just run
```bash
conda install pip
```
and then repeat the first step.
